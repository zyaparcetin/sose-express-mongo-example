## Getting started
&nbsp;
### NODE - EXPRESS - MONGODB

    ```  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>  

### Working with **env variables** and **.env** files
&nbsp;  
> Note: 
  > - We have automated for you the following step to make the copy from the **.env.example**:  
    > ```sh
    > cp .env.example .env
    > ```
  > - Please before starting the server update the **.env** file values accordingly if necessary  
  &nbsp;  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

To add new *env variables*:   
  - Add them directly in the **.env** file
  - Add a copy of this *env variables* with an example value (not the real one) in the **.env.example** file
&nbsp;

    > - There is a **class.puml** example file located in the **_architecture_** folder.  
  &nbsp;
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  To start working **_*.puml_** files:  
  
  - You can continue by editing the **class.puml** file   
  - Add additional **_*.puml_** files on that folder too.  
  &nbsp;  

  If you what to visualize a preview of the **class.puml** file or another **_*.puml_** file on the project, please select the file and on your keyboard press the following keys:
  <p>&nbsp;</p>  

  - _MacOS_: **Option + D**  
  
  - _Linux/Windows_: **Alt + D**  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  The above commands will automatically open a window that will show you live any updates that you make on the file.
